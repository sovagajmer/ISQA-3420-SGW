#Policy Document 
	
Context	 
	This policy is to determine if packages assessed by the NIST database will be implimented into the company. This 		policy will decide if developers will be able to use open-source code within company projects. 

	
Threshold  
	The minimum value that any software package is related to its defined phase of the project. 

	
Response  
	If the software package does not the minimum CVE for that phase of the project, a rejection of the use of the software package will be made. Depending on the phase of the project, the project may be delayed or may come to a hault. A case for appeal of software package rejection can be made. A manager or developer can make a case for submission to the policy management team. If the appeals case does not get approved. The the manager only can make one final case as to why the software package should be avaliable for use within the company. If that case is rejected a final time, there are no other options for appealing a case and the developer will need to find another software package to use.
