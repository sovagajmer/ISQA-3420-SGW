#Executive Summary


Problem Statement  
A large issue taking place in almost every company is monitoring the intake of external sources. Every corporation uses external source, there is no avoiding it. Asking developers to not use external source is like asking BMW to reinvent the wheel each time they produce a car. It simply does not make sense. While developers within corporations are going to use external source, measures can be put in place in order to monitor what external source is being brought into the company.
 
Solution 
Our solution for this issue includes creating a barrier between external source and the company. We propose putting measures in place that limit the intake of external source and also querying information on the source that is brought into the company. Our project in its entirety includes a Data Flow Diagram, Data Flow Diagram Dictionary, Entity Relationship Diagram, Sample Software Manifest & Sample Policy Document, Three Use Cases, and a Final Presentation.
