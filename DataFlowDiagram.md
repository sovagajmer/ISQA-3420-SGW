  Items to add  
  1) Provide information back to the developer  
  
      - Provide a way for the developer to know if the package contains issues/vulnerabilities 
      
  2) Make ‘Manage Code Streams’ more granular   
  
      - Break up 'Manage Code Streams' into multiple processes 
      
  3) Include policy information in the system   
  
      - Will probably need a policy database 
      
  4) Include manifest information in the system   
  
      - Up to us to decide
